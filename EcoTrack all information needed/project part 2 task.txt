Objec1ve
This part of the project focuses on developing a funcVonal web applicaVon prototype that
reflects the business idea (as in the assignment submission) and system requirements
documented in the SRS report. The prototype must include key features, proper system
architecture, and a working user interface that demonstrates core funcVonaliVes.
Requirements
The system must support THREE (3) user types, each with their own set of permissions:
1. Public User
• Browse by category and search for items/products/services
• Add items to cart
• Redirect to registration page upon checkout
2. Registered Member
• Register account (minimum fields: Full Name, Email, Password with validation)
• Login/Logout and edit profile
• Browse, search, add to cart, view transaction history
• Checkout and make dummy payment
• View on-screen or PDF receipt
• Receive email notifications
3. Administrator
• Login/Logout
• View registered members
• Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products/items and
prices
• View transaction records with daily/weekly/monthly filters
• Generate transaction reports (on-screen or PDF)Other Technical Requirements
• Responsive Web Design (mobile-friendly, fluid layout, adaptive typography,
responsive media).
• Security Implementation (XSS prevention, directory traversal/file inclusion
protection, SQL injection prevention).
• The main entry file must be named index.html or index.php.
• Technology stack:
o Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM
o Animation: anime.js or three.js (if used)
o Data Visualization: D3.js, Victory, React-vis, V Charts, Chart.js, Canvas API,
WebGL
o 3rd party APIs (optional)
• CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Wix, Drupal, Joomla) are NOT allowed.
• Front-end or back-end frameworks (eg. Bootstrap/ Angular/ React/ Node/ Yii/ Cake/
Laravel etc) may be used sparingly with proper documentation (MUST indicate
clearly which and how the tools are used).
• If AI tools are used, MUST clearly acknowledge and specify which tools and how
they were used.
Hosting & Accessibility
• The application must be hosted online and accessible for evaluation.
• It must be compatible with Google Chrome browser.
• Hosting must include:
o URL of the hosted web application
o Username and password for testing (DO NOT use third-party login like
Google/Facebook)
Submission Requirements
The group submission must include:
a) Official FCSIT assignment cover page (signed by all group members)
b) Acknowledging use of AI (refer to the template in this document)
c) Compressed folder (.zip) containing:
• Source code
• Database files
• DocumentaVon of framework/tools usage. Word or PDF, Times New Roman /
Calibri, size 11 or 12, Spacing: 1.15 lines, Page limit: 10 pages (including cover
page and acknowledgment)
• URL of group prototype web live hosVng address, which must be accessible
using a web browser over the Internet. The username and password of theweb hosVng account that was uVlised (DO NOT used “Log in with
Facebook/Google” or else you need to share your password).
• Proof of group discussion (e.g., meeVng screenshots, chat logs, minutes).
Penalty for Late Submission
• Minus 1 mark per day aier the due date.
• Submissions aier 7 days may not be accepted.
Addi1onal Guidelines
• Ensure clarity, originality, and proper formakng of your business plan.
• All figures and claims should be supported with credible data or references.
• Encourage creaVve presentaVon (e.g., infographics, tables, charts) while keeping
within the page limit.ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR USE OF AI
If you completed any work with the aid of an AI tool, assuming a sekng in which the
instructor gave permission for such tools to be used, you should always acknowledge the
use. Using the outputs of an AI tool without proper acknowledgement is equivalent to
liiing or paraphrasing a paragraph from a source without citaVon and alracts the same
sancVons. You can give this acknowledgement through a note or “methods secVon” at the
end of the assignment explaining, e.g., which AI tools were used, in which parts of the
process they were used, what were the prompts used to generate results, and what you
did with the outputs to add value.
One way this can be done is in a tabular form as shown below:
AI Tool used Prompt and output How the output was used in the assignment
AlternaVvely, if an AI tool was used to generate a more extensive set of intermediate
outputs that were then developed into a final product, you should preserve a full
transcript of the relevant interacVons with the AI as an appendix for submission with your
assignment. Your instructor may also require you to explicitly declare if AI tools were not
used in a part of your assignment, or for the whole assignment. In all cases, seek advice
from your course instructor.
